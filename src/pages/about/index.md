how:
  content1: >-
    The reason many software solutions fail is largely due to the lack of
    communication between the developer and the client. We've solved this issue
    through our method of consulting before and during the development process.
    This type of transparency is what ensures success when working together to
    meet your future goals. With only your specific needs in mind, we are able
    to design a detailed course of action tailored to fit your company.

    After consulting, we begin mapping a custom plan to implement technology and
    software based on your business's current needs. This process is what offers
    your company only the most advanced and effective technological solutions
    that you won't find elsewhere.

  header: Core Values
  tagline: >
    We are a team of expert generalists who believe in first principles. 

    We take pride in our ability and curiosity to master and collect expertise
    different industries, skills, and arts. This emphasis on collective
    knowledge produces a powerful collaboration between designers, engineers,

    A first principle is a basic truth that cannot be deduced any further. We
    use this ideology throughout our consulting process to dismiss dogma and
    create solutions instead of assuming them. This method ensures we are
    covering every possible approach in order to discover the best one.
