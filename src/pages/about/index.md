  content1: >-
    We are a technology consulting firm that offers a refreshing take on
    decluttering operating systems through automation. As the technology
    evolves, so do we, but more importantly so does your business. We are here
    to bridge the gap between your company's current struggles and the
    technology that will resolve them. Our vast understanding of both software
    development as well as business operations is what ensures our collaboration
    reaches maximum success. 
  content2: >-
    Because today's tech world is rapidly becoming more advanced & complex,
    we've handcrafted tools that make it easier to navigate the modern
    technological landscape. We empower businesses to become more efficient by
    automating their current systems and solving complex problems with simple
    tech-based solutions. Through harnessing the power of modern software, we
    provide you with the expertise needed to maximize technology's potential
    within your company. Before Sprinter, most businesses looking to update
    their systems were forced to choose between one-size-fits all software
    options that fail miserably due to lack of communication. We've solved this
    problem through our consulting before and during the development process.
    Our focus is on implementing new technology that save you both time and
    money.

  content1: >-
    Because we possess expertise in a broad array of different fields, we are
    able to dissect issues from an open-minded angle that optimizes success.
    Evolving with the technology is what we prioritize at Sprinter. Recognizing
    the fact that new technology can be both scary and sexy, we use our
    resources to acquaint your business with the power of modern software.
  content2: >-
    Do you feel like your business is lacking something, but don’t specifically
    know what? Do you recognize that your company could be better, but don’t
    know how? These are two questions that our team of highly-skilled experts
    are trained to answer. With only your specific needs in mind, we are able to
    design a detailed course of action tailored to fit your company.

    Our team is a unique blend of creatives, engineers, and developers who are
    knowledgeable in both business operations as well as software development.
    The entire process starts with a simple conversation. This is rooted in our
    belief that developing a relationship with our clients is just as important
    as developing the software. We believe many businesses are tapping into only
    a small portion of their potential. This is due to their lack of knowledge
    on new and available technology.

    People over Profit: “We never make decisions based solely on financial gain,

    we do business with knows that they are our priority, and that we will do
    everything we can to help them achieve their goals.”

    Work-Life Balance: “One of the key components for any type of organizational
    success starts with happy employees. That’s why from the beginning of any
    new client relationship, Sprinter makes sure to address the ways in which we
    can help workers contribute more overall value within the company by
    discovering ways to maximize their efficiency."

    Unlocking Human Potential: “We believe that through pairing great technology
    with capable workers, we are able to enhance individual performance and in
    return, enable them to contribute the pinnacle of their worth to your
    business.”
  header: Core Values
  tagline: >
    We are a team of expert generalists who believe in first principles. 

    This means we take pride in our ability and curiosity to master and collect
    expertise in various industries, skills, and arts. Our emphasis on
    collective knowledge produces a powerful collaboration between designers,
    engineers, and developers that your business won't find elsewhere. 

    A first principle is a basic truth that cannot be deduced any further. We
    use this ideology throughout our consulting process to dismiss dogma and
    create solutions instead of assuming them. This method ensures we are
    covering every possible approach in order to discover the best one.

    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
    roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
    2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
    College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
    word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
    comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
    (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
    treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
    first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
    in section 1.10.32.
