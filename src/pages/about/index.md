    to maximize their efficiency.

  tagline: >-
    We are a team of expert generalists who believe in first principles. This
    means we take pride in our ability and curiosity to master and collect
    expertise in various industries, skills, and arts. Our emphasis on
    collective knowledge produces a powerful collaboration between designers,
    engineers, and developers that your business won't find elsewhere. A first
    principle is a basic truth that cannot be deduced any further. We use this
    ideology throughout our consulting process to dismiss dogma and create
    solutions instead of assuming them. This method ensures we are covering
    every possible approach in order to discover the best one.

  header: What We Do
  slide1: >-
    We empower businesses to become more efficient by automating their current
    systems and solving complex problems with simple tech-based solutions. Our
    consulting process offers our clients a refreshing take on decluttering
    their operations through digital transformation. As the technology evolves,
    so do we, but more importantly so does your business. We are here to bridge
    the gap between your company's current struggles and the technology that
    will resolve them.
  slide2: >-
    We use technology to make businesses better. Our vast understanding of both
    software development as well as business operations, is what ensures our
    collaboration reaches maximum success. Because today's tech world is rapidly
    becoming more advanced & complex, we've handcrafted tools that make it
    easier to navigate the modern technological landscape. Through harnessing
    the power of modern software, we are able to optimize technology's potential
    within your current systems. 
  slide3: >-
    Before Sprinter, most businesses looking to update their systems were forced
    to choose between "off the shelf" software options that fail miserably due
    to lack of communication. We've solved this problem through our consulting
    before and during the development process. Our focus is and always will be
    directed toward implementing new technology that saves you both time and
    money.

  slide3: >-
    Our entire process starts with a simple conversation. This is rooted in our
    belief that developing a relationship with our clients is just as important
    as developing the software. We believe many businesses are tapping into only
    a small portion of their potential. Our goal is to introduce new and
    available technology that solves problems while optimizing overall workflow.
    We are result-oriented and will do whatever it takes to ensure the growth of
