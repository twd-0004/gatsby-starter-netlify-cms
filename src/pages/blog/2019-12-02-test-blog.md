Although their answers varied, there was an underlying theme of truthfulness when it came to what they really wanted to do when they graduated compared to what they planned on doing in order to support themselves financially. Even though this distinction is rooted in reality, we found it alarming that many students seemed to be pursuing careers they were not passionate about. At Sprinter, it is our goal to help people reach their full potential instead of settling for perceived comfort. We hope you enjoy listening to this experimental podcast as much as we did.
