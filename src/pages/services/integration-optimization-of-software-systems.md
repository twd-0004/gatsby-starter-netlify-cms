order: 6
description: New is not always better, even with technology. If improvement is
  needed, but replacement isnâ€™t possible, we can help you make the most of the
  software you have available through streamlining your workflow. We'll reduce
  frustrating gaps by building custom integrations and augmenting existing
  functionality with simple extensions and user interfaces that work to enhance
  accessibility.
